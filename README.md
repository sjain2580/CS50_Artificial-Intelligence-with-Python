CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python ðŸ§ 
This repository serves as a comprehensive portfolio for my solutions and explorations throughout Harvard's CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python course. Each project within this course provided hands-on experience with fundamental AI concepts, from search algorithms and knowledge representation to machine learning and natural language processing.

Course Overview
CS50 AI with Python delves into the core principles of artificial intelligence, allowing learners to implement various AI algorithms from scratch. The course covers topics such as:

Graph Search Algorithms: Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, A* Search.

Knowledge Representation: Propositional Logic, First-Order Logic.

Constraint Satisfaction Problems: Solving problems with interdependent variables.

Uncertainty: Probability, Bayesian Networks.

Machine Learning: Supervised Learning (Classification, Regression), Unsupervised Learning, Reinforcement Learning.

Neural Networks: Perceptrons, Convolutional Neural Networks, Deep Learning.

Natural Language Processing: Tokenization, Parsing, Attention Mechanisms.

Projects
Each project in this repository resides on its own dedicated branch and includes a README.md file with specific details about its implementation, challenges, and solutions. Below is a list of the projects completed:

Degrees: Implements a "Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon" style movie recommendation system using graph search.

Pajamas: (Example, replace with your actual project branches) A problem involving logical inference.

Minesweeper: An AI agent for playing the game of Minesweeper.

Shopping: A machine learning model to predict online shopper purchasing behavior.

Traffic: A convolutional neural network for classifying road signs.

Nim: An AI agent that learns to play the game of Nim optimally using reinforcement learning.

Parser: A natural language parser to analyze sentence structures.

Attention: Exploring self-attention mechanisms in Transformer models for NLP.
