# **CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python**

This repository serves as a comprehensive portfolio for my solutions and explorations throughout Harvard's CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python course. Each project within this course provided hands-on experience with fundamental AI concepts, from search algorithms and knowledge representation to machine learning and natural language processing.

## **Course Overview**

CS50 AI with Python delves into the core principles of artificial intelligence, allowing learners to implement various AI algorithms from scratch. The course covers topics such as:

- **Graph Search Algorithms**: Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, A* Search.

- **Knowledge Representation**: Propositional Logic, First-Order Logic.

- **Constraint Satisfaction Problems**: Solving problems with interdependent variables.

- **Uncertainty**: Probability, Bayesian Networks.

- **Machine Learning**: Supervised Learning (Classification, Regression), Unsupervised Learning, Reinforcement Learning.

- **Neural Networks**: Perceptrons, Convolutional Neural Networks, Deep Learning.

- **Natural Language Processing**: Tokenization, Parsing, Attention Mechanisms.

## **Projects**

Each project in this repository resides on its own dedicated branch and includes a README.md file with specific details about its implementation, challenges, and solutions.
Below is a list of the projects completed:

**1) Degrees**: Implemented a "Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon" style to find the shortest path between any two actors by choosing a sequence of movies that connects them.

**2) Tic-Tac-Toe**: Implemented an AI to play Tic-Tac-Toe optimally, using Minimax.

**3) Knights**: Implemented a solution solve logic "Knights & Knaves" puzzles.

**4) Minesweeper**: Implemented an AI for playing the game of Minesweeper.

**5) Pagerank**: Implemented an AI to rank web pages by importance.

**6) Heredity**: Implemented an AI to assess the likelihood that a person will have a particular genetic trait.

**7) Crossword**: Implemented an AI to generate crossword puzzles.

**8) Shopping**: Implemented a machine learning model to predict online shopper purchasing behavior.

**9) Nim**: Implemented an AI agent that learns to play the game of Nim optimally using reinforcement learning.

**10) Traffic**: Implemented a convolutional neural network for classifying traffic signs in a photogrph.

**11) Parser**: Implemented a natural language parser to parse sentences and extract noun phrases.

**12) Attention**: Implemented an AI to predict a masked word in a text sequence.
